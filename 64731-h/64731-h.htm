SERMON.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And the Lord spake unto you out of the
midst of the fire: ye heard the voice of the words, but saw no
similitude; only ye heard a voice.&nbsp; And he declared unto you
his covenant which he commanded you to perform, even ten
commandments; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.&nbsp;
And the Lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and
judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over
to possess it.&nbsp; Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves,
for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the Lord spake
unto you in Horeb, out of the midst of the fire, lest ye corrupt
yourselves, and make you a graven image, the similitude of any
figure, the likeness of male or female.&rdquo;&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Deut</span>. iv. 12&ndash;17, <i>the passage on the
outer page of the fragment taken out of the Fire</i>, <i>and
given to the Preacher upon the spot</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">God</span> who at sundry times and
in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the
prophets, hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom
he hath appointed heir of all things, and by whom also he made
the worlds.&nbsp; Therefore we ought to give the more earnest
heed to the things which we have heard.&nbsp; For if they escaped
not who refused him who spake on earth, much more shall not we
escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Such are
the solemn sanctions under which God has entrusted us with the
Book of Life; nor can these sanctions be considered too weighty
by any who rightly appreciate that gift.&nbsp; Next to the gift
of God&rsquo;s incarnate Son and of his Blessed Spirit, we rank
the Book divine.&nbsp; We are thankful for the Church and its
ordinances and means, and if we may distinguish between the
Church and its ministers, we are thankful for them too; but we
value the Sacred Volume above all institutions, however sacred,
and above all men of whatever character.&nbsp; It is not our
intention at this time to elaborate arguments for the necessity
of a divine revelation; suffice to say, that without one we could
have no certainty in matters of faith, and no authorised standard
in matters of morality.&nbsp; That &ldquo;the world by wisdom
knew not God&rdquo; is proved by the history of all nations,
ancient and modern.&nbsp; The classic times of Greece and Rome
were as destitute of correct knowledge of the true God as were
the times most distant and barbaric, while the highest culture of
arts and science did nothing whatever for pure morality; God,
therefore, for his own glory and man&rsquo;s good, condescended
to speak from heaven, and give us a revelation of his will.&nbsp;
It was necessary that this revelation should be a written one:
for in matters of such importance no man could be satisfied with
its transmission by tradition.&nbsp; Tradition never <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>did and never
can transmit any dictate of either God or man with
certainty.&nbsp; What tradition can do as a medium of supplying
knowledge from the past may be seen in the case of those nations
which bordered the kingdom of Israel&mdash;whose fathers,
descending from the patriarchs, must have had some knowledge of
both God&rsquo;s character and his claims; yet these nations had
forgotten all, and lapsed into the most contemptible
idolatry.&nbsp; It may be seen, in the case of the Israelites
themselves.&nbsp; How simple and correct the views which Abraham
their father entertained of God, and yet so completely did his
descendants forget all this during their sojourn in Egypt that
Moses found it necessary to ask the Lord by what name he should
speak of him to them.&nbsp; The uncertainty of tradition may be
further seen by a reference to the days of our Lord, when we find
that by it the elders made void the law of God.&nbsp; Tradition
is often at fault in its very origin.&nbsp; Look at one which
rose among the disciples themselves.&nbsp; The Saviour, before
ascending to heaven, informed Peter of the manner of his death,
on which this Apostle was curious to know what should be the lot
of John, who was coming up at the time.&nbsp; The Lord did not
think it wise to satisfy that curiosity, and said, &ldquo;If I
will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee, follow thou
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then went this saying abroad among the brethren,
that <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>that
disciple should not die; yet the sacred historian tells us, that
for this tradition there was no foundation in fact.&nbsp; And who
among us could tell in this day what were the doctrines of our
own glorious Reformers, if their teachings had not been placed
upon record?&nbsp; Whether, therefore, the dictum be inspired or
uninspired, it cannot with any certainty and authority be
transmitted through the medium of tradition.&nbsp; God,
therefore, not only spoke from heaven, but commanded that the
Scriptures should be &ldquo;<i>written for our
learning</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the passage before us not only
speaks of a record of the teachings and commandments of God, it
also informs us that in the absence or neglect of that record men
will be not merely ignorant of God&rsquo;s character, but corrupt
themselves, and fall into idolatry.&nbsp; It therefore seems to
teach with great force the tendency of our nature to some
religious system, and to us it appears plain that whether we
trace that tendency to traditions of the past, to some law of the
mind, or to the &ldquo;light which lighteneth every man that
cometh into the world,&rdquo; the fact itself is
indisputable.&nbsp; Man every where seems to feel a need of
something beyond himself to which to look, on which to
lean&mdash;the object of his hope, or the object of his
dread.&nbsp; And where is it that men do not realize the warning
of the text, that without the Word of God they will corrupt
themselves <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>and set up images, the likeness of male or female, or
some other thing.&nbsp; Perhaps, indeed, no age of the world, and
no portion of the human race, could more fully verify the fact
than the times in which we live, and the men whose conduct is the
occasion of these remarks.&nbsp; They have not thought it needful
to consult the Word of God to remember his <span
class="GutSmall">TEN</span> commandments, and have therefore
forgotten that God is not represented by any similitudes, and
have made to themselves images, the likeness of male and of
female.&nbsp; There is, indeed, so striking a discrepancy between
the text and the worship of images that it can surprise no one
that those who practise the one should renounce the other.&nbsp;
No one can be pleased with that which bears testimony against
conduct he is not prepared to abandon.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Every one
that doeth evil hateth the light</i>, <i>neither cometh to the
light</i>, <i>lest his deeds should be reproved</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But since the right course is to abandon the practice, not to
insult the witness, this discrepancy is not a mitigation but an
aggravation of the conduct of which we complain.&nbsp; We need
not say that we refer to the burning of the Holy Bible in open
day, very near the place in which we are met, and under the eye
of Roman Catholic and Protestant.&nbsp; We are aware that from
policy or shame the deed has been denied, and, therefore, our
first business will be to place before you the evidence <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>upon which our
charge rests.&nbsp; On Monday last, about half-past ten
o&rsquo;clock in the morning, having heard that Bibles were being
burned in the yard of the Roman Catholic Chapel, we proceeded to
the spot; there, at the lower end of the chapel, and in sight of
every one that passed up or down the street, we saw a large heap
of cinders from books or paper.&nbsp; Around the edges of the
heap there were patches of flame.&nbsp; A number of persons, one
of them a boy in the dress of an acholyte, stood round the
fire.&nbsp; They were kicking books, that were evidently small
pocket Bibles, into the fire.&nbsp; One of these persons turned
round and said, &ldquo;<i>We are burning Bibles</i>,&rdquo; and
asked, &ldquo;Have you any more to bring?&rdquo;&nbsp; And then,
to leave no doubt upon our mind, took up a portion of one out of
the fire before our eyes and placed it in our hands.&nbsp; This
fragment you now behold, and from its first page we have selected
the text.&nbsp; Can evidence like this be disputed or set
aside?</p>
<p>Our next duty will be to consider, the <i>wickedness</i> of
the deed.&nbsp; In doing this we wish you to observe, that God
threatens with severe punishment those persons who merely do not
receive the truth in the love of it; still more severely such as
will not hear, who turn away the shoulder or stop the ear; but
most of all the men who dare to treat his commandment with
contempt.&nbsp; Now we say that the act complained of was one
that treated <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>the Word of God with the utmost contempt possible.&nbsp;
The burning of a book is every where, and from time immemorial
has been, looked upon as the worst brand that can be stamped upon
its character.&nbsp; In the times of the Apostles we read of some
who, when converted from their evil practices, brought their
curious books of occult arts and burned them as evidence of their
detestation of the books and the sincerity of their
conversion.&nbsp; The burning has been sometimes conducted by the
hands of the common executioner.&nbsp; With the knowledge of
these facts, and that the deed should be regarded in this light,
the Holy Book of God was, in this nineteenth century of the
Christian Era, committed to the consuming flame by the authority
of the Redemptorist Fathers.&nbsp; It must not be pleaded, as any
mitigation of the daring impiety, that it was the Protestant
version that was burned: for many Roman Catholics of high
authority have admitted this version to be the Word of God, and
the difference between it and the Douay version, in all essential
matters, is not such as to allow any candid man of either creed
to hesitate to confess that either is the Holy Bible.&nbsp; This
deed was done under the most aggravating circumstances.&nbsp; It
would have been great rebellion against God to have burned his
Word alone in one&rsquo;s own chamber; but in that case the
insult would not have been so emphatic or so daring.&nbsp; <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>It was done
before the face of many Protestants, and under such circumstances
that it must come to the knowledge of all Protestants in the
town, if not throughout the kingdom.&nbsp; It was an act not
merely calculated to insult their creed, but to provoke them in
the highest degree.&nbsp; The Book of God was burned in revolting
association.&nbsp; To increase the ignominy of our Lord&rsquo;s
crucifixion he was placed between two thieves; malefactors who,
according to their own admission, suffered justly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He was numbered with transgressors.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the
same principle, to make the odium cast upon the precious volume
more complete, it was placed in the same heap with the worst
productions of infidelity and licentiousness.&nbsp; This outrage
upon Protestant feeling was committed at a time when it became
all men who loved their country to unite in seeking its
welfare.&nbsp; Amidst the hardships and dangers of war, and when
we were looking forward with hope to see our country fully
resuscitated from the dreadful consequences of pestilence and
famine.&nbsp; Thus we find in every point of view, and by all its
accompaniments, the deed was one of daring impiety and
provocation.&nbsp; What judgments may be expected to
follow.&nbsp; Can any one suppose that God will not visit for
these things? that he will not be avenged for such a deed as
this.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because I called and ye refused; I will laugh
at your calamities and mock <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>when your fear cometh.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This seems specially to apply to individuals.&nbsp; &ldquo;If any
man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the
plagues that are written in this book; and if any man shall take
away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take
away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city,
and from the things which are written in this book.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This seems to refer to the Church.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because they
received not the love of the truth that they might be saved, God
shall send them strong delusion&mdash;that they should believe a
lie, that they all might be damned who believed not the truth,
but had pleasure in unrighteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; This evidently
applies to such as knowingly turn from the true to a false
system.&nbsp; What God will do unto the nation that turns away
from and despises the holy Word of God may be seen in such
threatenings as the following: &ldquo;If thou wilt not observe to
do all the words of this law that are written in this book, that
thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name, The Lord Thy
God, then the Lord will make thy plagues wonderful, and the
plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance,
and sore sickness, and of long continuance.&nbsp; And it shall
come to pass that as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good,
and to multiply you, so the Lord will rejoice over you to
destroy, and to bring you to nought.&rdquo;&nbsp; All these
judgments are threatened against the rejection of the
Word&mdash;in <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>fact, the mere neglect of it: public insult never seemed
to be contemplated at all.&nbsp; The only instance upon record,
in any wise resembling the deed we are speaking of, is that of
Jehoiakim, who burned the roll containing the prophecy which God
had commanded Jeremiah to utter against Jerusalem.&nbsp; And for
this burning God threatened the king with early death; informed
him he should have the burial of an ass; should have no man to
sit upon his throne, and that the nation he ruled over should be
visited with wasting desolation.&nbsp; Now, to all these
judgments is the nation liable that can be guilty of a crime like
this.&nbsp; All who approve of the deed, or who do not protest
against it, must be in danger of God&rsquo;s displeasure; and we
remember that Bible burning was practised just before the
judgments of 1846.</p>
<p>Let us, then, address a few observations on this solemn
subject to all classes in the land.&nbsp; And, first, to Roman
Catholics themselves, at least, to such as have any moderation
and candour.&nbsp; Surely there must be many among them who do
not approve the deed.&nbsp; We would ask the men of intelligence,
and rank, and property&mdash;men who are anxious for the welfare
of their country, and who especially desire the social
amelioration of the poorer classes.&nbsp; What do these men
expect from the burning of that book which more than any other
teaches the principles of industry, and leads, under God, to the
exercise of self-reliance?&nbsp; What <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>do those men hope from the deed, who
have publicly acknowledged that the difference between Ulster and
other parts of Ireland in these respects is traceable to the
circulation of the Bible alone?&nbsp; We ask such Romanists as
have any interest in literature, what they think of the burning
of a book that has done more for the advancement of true learning
than all others put together?&nbsp; We ask the men of that creed
who profess liberal principles, what they think of the burning of
a book which is the Magna Charta of our privileges&mdash;the
palladium of our civil and religious liberty?&nbsp; Above all, we
ask those who have any interest in piety or morality, do they
consent to ignore a book which is the source of the one and
standard of the other?&nbsp; Now, it will not do for such Roman
Catholics as these to say, they did not do the deed, and were not
cognizant of it.&nbsp; It was done under the direction of their
clergy; and, until they protest against the deed, they must be
held answerable for its results.&nbsp; Suppose the deed to have
been done&mdash;if I may venture upon such a supposition&mdash;by
a minister of any Protestant community, would not every minister
and every man of that community throughout the kingdom be held
accountable for the outrage?&nbsp; And we do not hesitate to tell
the Roman Catholics that their Protestant fellow countrymen can
place no confidence in any profession of moderation or liberality
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>till they
wash their hands of an enormity such as this.&nbsp; We have been
informed that during the visit of these men many persons from the
different Protestant bodies have joined the Church of Rome.&nbsp;
Whether this be so or not, we have no means to determine, and God
forbid that we should interfere with the fullest exercise of the
understanding or liberty of conscience, but if there have been
any who, from levity of disposition or sinister motives, have
forsaken the teaching of the Scriptures, and have aided in this
deed or given it their countenance, we dare not address to them
other language than that of this holy book: &ldquo;For if we sin
wilfully, after that we have received the knowledge of the truth,
there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin; but a certain fearful
looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour
the adversaries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lastly, we address ourselves to Protestants: and what duties
devolve on them in this case?&nbsp; We hope no one will be so
foolish as to say&mdash;none.&nbsp; The persons concerned in this
act are our fellow-subjects&mdash;our next-door
neighbours&mdash;and with whom we are brought into contact every
day in the duties of life; it is therefore impossible to consider
ourselves mere disinterested hearers or spectators of the
deed.&nbsp; As citizens, as Christians&mdash;and, above all, as
lovers of the Bible, we are deeply concerned therein.&nbsp; Let
us, <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>then,
first of all, thoroughly appreciate its real character.&nbsp;
There must be no blinking the question or softening it down;
there could be no real charity or generosity in this, but a mere
extenuation of a dreadful crime.&nbsp; We must apprehend the
danger of living in contact with a system that could sanction it,
and rouse ourselves to action.&nbsp; We must not, indeed,
transfer the hatred we bear to the act to those who committed
it.&nbsp; This may be hard; but the Gospel requires it.&nbsp;
There must be no anger, malice, or revenge&mdash;nothing
inconsistent with the utmost charity, the love of God and
man.&nbsp; But while we must think nothing, feel nothing, do
nothing, which charity forbids; all that charity allows, all that
it demands, is expected from us now.&nbsp; The love of
country&mdash;the love of learning&mdash;of liberty, religion,
and of God&mdash;calls us to wake to action.&nbsp; All that we
can do by prayer, by personal effort, by the multiplication of
evangelical agencies, is forced upon us now.&nbsp; Especially,
what a lecture does this read us on union among ourselves, union
among all evangelical denominations.&nbsp; In view of
transactions like this what are our differences&mdash;can they be
worthy one unbrotherly thought.&nbsp; Let us love our several
systems much, but our Saviour more; let us wish well to our
party, but long more eagerly for the salvation of our
country.&nbsp; Let us unite to press upon all men <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>more fully
the great doctrine of the Reformation and of the
Bible&mdash;justification by faith alone.&nbsp; Let us agree to
declare throughout the length and breadth of the land that he
that hath the Son hath life.&nbsp; He that hath the Son as the
foundation of his faith&mdash;he that hath the Son within him as
the hope of glory&mdash;that hath the Son before him as the
pattern of his life&mdash;he, whatever his creed or his party,
hath life; he lives &ldquo;by the faith of the Son of God&rdquo;
on earth, and is passing to the fuller life in heaven.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; on the other hand, &ldquo;he that hath not the
Son hath not life;&rdquo; he that hath not the Son in these
respects, with whatever church he stands connected&mdash;whatever
opinions he subscribes&mdash;whatever forms he
practises&mdash;hath no real life on earth, and can have none in
heaven.&nbsp; Should God of his infinite mercy, as the result of
these doings, give us that grace, that will unite us more closely
among ourselves, give us more singleness of eye in our efforts,
and supply us with greater zeal for the salvation of our
fellow-countrymen&mdash;what was intended by the Redemptorist
Fathers as the laying of the topstone of their triumph may turn
out the loosening of a stone in the mystic building, and
accelerate the period when heaven and earth will unite in the
cry&mdash;&ldquo;BABYLON THE GREAT IS FALLEN!&rdquo;</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
